# Leap-Boy
A very basic 2D platformer named after Mario's original name: Jump Man. 
Controls are arrow keys with jump being the up arrow. 
Can stick on walls if there is a solid block below the wall bolck you are against but cannot travel vertically while against the wall. 
If you fall off a platform without jumping you can perform a mid-air jump. 
Coins are yellow squares, every 10 coins collected overall gets a new life. 
Enimies are red squars that can be jumped on to kill and give a small vertical boost when killed. 
Big enimies require 3 hits to kill and they remove all regular enimies when killed. 
Hitting enimies horizontally causes you to lose coins and if at 0 coins you lose a life. 
Grey boxes are jump boosts that give you vertical height and the amount varies depending on how you interact with them. 
Green boxes are warp panels that take you to the next level, 5 levels total. 
If you die on your 0 life the game restarts you.
